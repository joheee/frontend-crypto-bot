              At CryptoOverseerX, we are committed to providing you with
              high-quality trading signals and ensuring your satisfaction.
              However, if you do not achieve a profit after following our
              signals for three consecutive months with a quarterly, annual, or
              lifetime subscription, we offer a full refund under the following
              terms and conditions:
            </div>
            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>Eligibility Period:</strong> The refund guarantee
                applies only to users who have maintained an active quarterly,
                annual, or lifetime subscription for at least three consecutive
                months.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Active Participation:</strong> To qualify for a refund,
                subscribers must demonstrate active participation by following
                100% of the trading signals provided during the three-month
                period. This includes entering and exiting trades according to
                the signals and recommendations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Proof of Trading Activity:</strong> Subscribers
                requesting a refund must provide proof of trading activity for
                the three-month period, such as transaction history or trading
                logs, to verify that the signals were followed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No Profit:</strong> The refund applies only if the
                subscriber did not achieve a net profit after following the
                signals for the full three-month period. Net profit is defined
                as the total earnings from trades minus any losses and trading
                fees.

              <li>

                <strong>Limitations:</strong> Refunds are not available for
                monthly subscriptions, nor for traders who deviate significantly
                from the signals provided, use excessive leverage, or engage in
                other high-risk trading behaviors that may impact the outcomes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>One-Time Refund:</strong> Each subscriber is eligible
                for a one-time refund only. After receiving a refund, they will
